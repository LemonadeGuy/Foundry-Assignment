Usage java Main <path to file with list of conference talks> 

This is my attempt at the conference solving problem. There are many improvements that can be implemented 
1)Moving the start, end, morning and afternoon requirements into config files. This will allow you to very easily adjust the conference parameters i.e. if I wanted to start at 7am instead of 9am and maybe wanted a earlier end, say 3pm. 

2) One could also schedule the morning and evening talks simutalneously, optimizing on execution time. However, my approach here was more procedural (i.e. Let one method do one thing). 

3) Make it more interactive - either allow a user to input times and do some validation based on the given constraints to either request new Talks and topics or ask the user if they'd be comfortable going outside the constraints i.e. starting the networking session before 4 or creating some filler activities to satisfy the requirements.  

Great, thank you for listening to my babbling.
